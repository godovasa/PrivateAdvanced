# SecretForge

**Privacy-preserving computation platform on Zama FHEVM**

SecretForge enables private computation where data and algorithms remain encrypted throughout processing. Built on Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine, the platform performs computations over encrypted inputs without ever decrypting data, ensuring absolute confidentiality while maintaining verifiable results.

---

## What is SecretForge?

SecretForge is a decentralized platform that allows users to execute computations on sensitive data without exposing that data to anyone—including the platform operators, validators, or other users. By leveraging Zama FHEVM, SecretForge enables homomorphic computation, meaning calculations can be performed directly on encrypted data.

**Core Promise**: Input data encrypted, processing encrypted, outputs encrypted—only authorized users see results.

## Why SecretForge?

### The Privacy Problem

Traditional computation requires exposing data:
- **Cloud Computing**: Data sent to servers unencrypted
- **Blockchain**: All data visible on-chain
- **Multi-party Computation**: Requires trust in participants
- **Encrypted Storage**: Must decrypt to process

**SecretForge Solution**: Compute over encrypted data—no decryption needed.

### Key Advantages

**Data Confidentiality**
- Inputs encrypted before submission
- Processing occurs over ciphertexts
- Outputs encrypted until authorized reveal
- No plaintext exposure at any stage

**Computation Verifiability**
- All operations recorded on-chain
- Cryptographic proofs of correctness
- Immutable computation history
- Public verification of results

**No Trust Required**
- No trusted third parties
- Decentralized execution
- Open-source codebase
- Transparent operations

## How SecretForge Works

### Computation Lifecycle

**Phase 1: Input Preparation**
1. User encrypts input data using FHE public key
2. Encrypted inputs submitted to smart contract
3. Inputs stored as encrypted ciphertexts
4. Computation request created

**Phase 2: Homomorphic Processing**
1. Smart contract receives computation request
2. Encrypted inputs processed using FHE operations
3. Intermediate results remain encrypted
4. Computation proceeds over ciphertexts

**Phase 3: Result Generation**
1. Encrypted result computed from encrypted inputs
2. Result stored as encrypted ciphertext
3. Computation proof generated
4. Result available for authorized reveal

**Phase 4: Result Access**
1. Authorized user requests result
2. Threshold key holders decrypt result
3. Result revealed to authorized party
4. Result remains encrypted for others

## Computation Examples

### Example 1: Private Aggregation

**Scenario**: Calculate average salary from encrypted salary data

**Process:**
1. Multiple users encrypt their salaries
2. Encrypted salaries submitted to SecretForge
3. Smart contract computes sum (homomorphically)
4. Count calculated (homomorphically)
5. Average computed (homomorphically)
6. Result revealed to authorized analyst
7. Individual salaries remain encrypted

**Result**: Analyst sees average salary, never individual salaries.

### Example 2: Encrypted Search

**Scenario**: Search encrypted medical records for matching conditions

**Process:**
1. Medical records encrypted and stored
2. Search query encrypted
3. Matching performed over encrypted data
4. Encrypted results generated
5. Results revealed to authorized researcher
6. Individual records remain private

**Result**: Researcher sees matching records, others remain encrypted.

### Example 3: Private Analytics

**Scenario**: Compute statistics on encrypted transaction data

**Process:**
1. Transactions encrypted before submission
2. Statistical operations (mean, variance) computed homomorphically
3. Encrypted statistics generated
4. Results revealed for reporting
5. Individual transactions remain encrypted

**Result**: Statistical insights available, transaction details private.
